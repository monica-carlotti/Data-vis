## Overview
Welcome to the C7083 assignment by Monica Carlotti. This visual essay delves into insights derived from the Tidy Tuesday challenge, a collaborative initiative in the R programming community. The dataset employed in this analysis originates from the Tidy Tuesday challenge titled "Global Crop Yields" and is sourced from Our World in Data.

## Dataset Focus
This analysis centers around key aspects of agricultural data, encompassing the following focal points:

1. **Crop Yields:** Examining data on the yield of various staple crops over time.
2. **Fertilizer Application:** Analyzing trends and patterns in fertilizer application.
3. **Land Area for Cereal Production:** Investigating changes in land area dedicated to cereal production since 1961.
4. **Arable Land Requirements:** Assessing the arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops, normalized to the baseline year 1961.
